NoOne’sJudging ✍️

A safe space for writers to express without fear.

NoOne’sJudging is a platform built to give writers the freedom to share their thoughts, poetry, and stories without the fear of being judged. Unlike social media, where negativity often discourages creativity, this project is designed as a judgment-free zone where like-minded people can connect and express themselves openly.

Currently, this is a frontend prototype built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React). It showcases the vision of creating a clean, distraction-free writing platform, with future plans to integrate backend support, AI moderation, and community features.
